                My name is Mario, and I've spent over twenty years in software development—writing code and leading teams since 2002. I've worked at nine different companies, and let me tell you something: building good development teams is hard work.

                This article shares real stuff I've learned along the way—not just what worked, but also what didn't. My mistakes can save you time and trouble when you're building your own teams.

                Here's what I'll cover:

                1. Understanding how teams grow and change over time
                2. Using Tuckman's Model as a practical tool at each stage
                3. Tips for hiring and keeping good people on your team
                4. Big mistakes I made (so you don't have to make them too)

                ---

                ## The Team Development Cycle

                Building teams isn't a straight line—it's more like a circle that keeps going around. People join, people leave, projects change, and your team has to adjust. Tuckman's Model helps us make sense of what's happening:

                ![Tuckman's Stages of Group Development](../assets/articles/building-high-performing-teams-lessons-from-a-developer-leader/ee776a65-e78c-4856-8128-6096214d5442.png)

                ### Stage 1: Forming — Building The Foundation 😶‍🌫️😏🫡🤐🤗

                #### The Hiring Challenges

                Everything starts with hiring. This is where many team leads mess up first: they don't see the real cost of finding new people.

                When you don't have much money to spend (and who does?), hiring can drag on forever. You think you're being careful by screening lots of candidates, but meanwhile, positions stay empty and your current team struggles to cover the gaps.

                The big question I learned to ask is: **What am I really hiring for?**

                Do you need someone to fix an urgent problem right now? Or are you building a team for the long run (more than 18 months)? For long-term projects, it's often better to hire developers with solid basics who can grow, rather than chasing specialists who cost more.

                #### From Individuals to a Team

                Once you've hired people, the "Forming" stage begins. This is when team members first come together, often feeling unsure about their roles and how they'll work with each other.

                During this stage, focus on:

                - Building trust and safety
                - Making roles clear
                - Reminding everyone why the team exists
                - Creating open communication

                **Real-world example:** When I got a new team of five developers with very different skill levels, I started weekly coding challenges where they paired up to solve problems. This helped them get to know each other and see each other's strengths quickly.

                As a leader, be visible and clear during this stage. New team members need guidance on what you expect, how things work, and what the goals are. Don't assume anything is obvious—even experienced developers need help when joining a new team.

                ### Stage 2: Storming — Navigating Conflicts and Challenges 🤬🤐😖🤯😡

                As people get comfortable, they start speaking their minds more, and conflicts pop up. This is actually a good sign—it means people care enough to say what they think. But if you don't handle it well, these conflicts can cause big problems.

                During the Storming stage:

                - People argue about technical approaches
                - Team members question the way things are done
                - Power struggles happen
                - Work might slow down for a while

                **Real-world example:** In one project, two senior developers kept arguing about coding styles. Instead of letting them keep fighting, I organized a meeting where each could explain their ideas with examples. Then we worked together to create best practices everyone could live with.

                Your leadership style needs to change during this stage. Instead of just giving directions, you become more of a mediator. Help your team:

                - Listen to understand, not just to respond
                - See disagreements as chances to find better solutions
                - Focus on the problem, not the personalities
                - Balance making their point with understanding others' views

                #### The Retention Challenge During Storming

                The Storming phase is when you're most likely to lose team members. Conflict makes people uncomfortable, and they might start looking for jobs elsewhere. This is when retention strategies become super important.

                As a lead, your job is to protect your team—not by blocking everything, but by supporting them. Let them try things while being there when they need help. Be honest: if someone wants to try something risky but promising, remind them that big rewards come with big risks—and they should have a backup plan.

                Remember though: no matter what you do, some developers will leave. That's normal—but how you handle it shapes your team culture. When someone leaves, treat it as a natural change rather than a betrayal.

                ### Stage 3: Norming — Finding Your Rhythm 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽👏🙏

                As conflicts get resolved, the team starts to establish ways of working that everyone supports. During this stage:

                - Collaboration gets much better
                - Team members trust each other more
                - Processes become smoother
                - Productivity goes up

                **Real-world example:** A junior developer once wanted to completely redo a module because he thought it was "ugly." Instead of saying no, I let him try it within a set time frame and with a backup plan. Everyone learned from this, and the team appreciated having the freedom to try things without risking the whole project.

                Your leadership style should change again during Norming. Step back and give the team more freedom, while staying available for guidance. Create space for:

                - Trying new things (with reasonable limits)
                - Sharing knowledge between team members
                - Improving processes based on team feedback
                - Celebrating small wins and learning from mistakes

                #### Reinforcing Retention During Norming

                As work becomes more routine, some developers—especially your best ones—might get bored and look for new challenges. To prevent this:

                - Give them challenging tasks that help them grow
                - Create opportunities to learn new technologies
                - Recognize good work publicly
                - Talk openly about career growth

                Money becomes more important during this stage. While a good work environment matters a lot, real-life expenses can't be ignored. Even happy employees might leave for better pay. If you have the budget and someone deserves it, don't wait to offer better pay before they start looking elsewhere.

                ### Stage 4: Performing — Reaching Excellence ⌚🧐🤖

                When a team reaches the Performing stage, they work together really well. The signs include:

                - Problems get solved quickly and creatively
                - Team members anticipate what others need
                - Communication is clear and efficient
                - The team consistently delivers good results

                At this stage, your leadership role changes to strategic guidance. Focus on:

                - Connecting the team's work to bigger company goals
                - Challenging the team with more complex problems
                - Removing roadblocks from outside the team
                - Making sure the team's achievements get noticed

                **Real-world example:** One of my teams got so good that they started finding improvements across the whole organization—not just in their own code. They created tools that other teams started using too, creating a ripple effect of positive change.

                #### The Performing Paradox and Retention

                Strangely, the Performing stage can create a new risk: boredom. When skilled professionals master their current challenges, they naturally want new ones. To keep talent at this stage:

                - Create opportunities for team members to teach others
                - Involve them in big decisions and planning
                - Support them in exploring new technologies
                - Consider creating smaller, specialized teams to tackle new challenges

                For employers, this means investing in people, planning for the long term—or risking losing your investment.

                For employees seeking growth, remember that getting ahead requires showing additional value, not just spending time. Compare these two approaches to asking for a raise:

                1. **"I've been here for a year, always doing my best, never being late, and following all procedures. I deserve a raise."**

                2. **"I've been focused on backend development, but noticed we need BI skills. I've been learning in this area and am ready to take on more work. A salary increase would support my growth while helping fill this gap in our team."**

                The second approach shows how your growth helps the company too—making it much more convincing.

                ### Stage 5: Adjourning — Embracing Change 🏎️🚀🦾🙋‍♂️👋🥲

                This stage recognizes that all teams eventually face big changes. Projects end, reorganizations happen, and team makeup changes.

                During Adjourning:

                - Celebrate what the team accomplished
                - Document what you learned
                - Provide clarity about what comes next
                - Support team members through emotional changes

                When handled well, Adjourning isn't an ending but a transformation. Team members take their experiences to new contexts, making future teams and projects better.

                ## Lessons From My Biggest Mistakes

                ![Tuckman's Stages of Group Development](../assets/articles/building-high-performing-teams-lessons-from-a-developer-leader/07e85fd3-93e6-4fde-bb57-8bc8085b4ee7.png)

                Over my years in development and leadership, I've made plenty of mistakes. Here are three big ones that taught me valuable lessons:

                ### 1. Thinking the team is more important than the company

                While your team should be your priority as a leader, the company must be your team's priority. This isn't about blind loyalty but recognizing that teams exist to deliver value. If a team doesn't deliver well, it affects the whole organization—potentially resulting in lost opportunities, revenue, and eventually, jobs.

                The balance is tricky but important: fight for your team while ensuring they understand how their work connects to the company's success.

                ### 2. Expecting others to love the company and project as much as I do

                Leadership roles attract people who feel deeply invested in their work—almost as if the projects or company are part of who they are. This passion can be powerful but also create blind spots.

                Developers have different motivations. Some will work extra hours and go above and beyond, while others keep clear boundaries between work and personal life. Neither way is better, but understanding these differences helps you lead more effectively. Recognize that everyone has different priorities, and design your team to work with this reality rather than fighting it.

                ### 3. Ignoring the importance of good compensation

                Culture, work-life balance, and interesting projects matter a lot—but they don't pay rent or grocery bills. Even the most engaged employees may leave for better pay, especially in today's market.

                If you have high performers who deliver exceptional value, fight for their compensation before they're forced to look elsewhere. The cost of replacing them—both in money and in lost knowledge and momentum—almost always exceeds the cost of keeping them.

                ---

                ## ## Final Thoughts 💡

                Building and maintaining good development teams is never "done." It's a continuous cycle of forming, storming, norming, and performing—with team makeup changing along the way. New members join, bringing fresh perspectives and temporarily returning the team to earlier stages. Others leave, creating opportunities for remaining members to step up.

                The leader's role changes throughout this cycle, from guide to mediator to coach to strategic advisor. Flexibility becomes your greatest asset—knowing when to step in and when to step back.

                Remember that recruitment isn't just about filling roles—it's about finding the right people who fit with your company's vision and culture while bringing the skills you need. Retention requires more than competitive salaries—it's about creating an environment where talented professionals can do their best work, grow their skills, and see a future for themselves.

                A strong team doesn't form overnight, but with patience, flexibility, and continuous learning, you can navigate these challenges and build a team that not only performs but thrives—even as it evolves.
