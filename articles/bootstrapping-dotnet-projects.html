                A solid foundation is essential for building maintainable and scalable applications. Since 2002, I've encountered countless challenges, discovered solutions, and gained valuable insights‚Äîboth at work and from various sources across the internet.

                **Nzr.Acme** is the culmination of these lessons, structured as a single repository: a bootstrapped .NET backend project that serves as a foundation for small to medium-sized applications, with the flexibility to scale into larger solutions with minimal effort.

                This article is the first in a *seven-part* series covering the "DevOps Days" for the Acme project ‚Äî a guide to help you build your next .NET application or enhance an existing one:

                1. **Bootstrapping .NET projects**: How I built Nzr.Acme to streamline project setup and accelerate development (*You're here* üìç)
                2. **Scaffolding .NET solution like a pro**: Streamlining .NET Development with Proper Project Structure and Automation.
                3. **Build and Test Pipeline**: Ensuring Code Quality with GitHub Actions.
                4. **Code Analysis**: Integrating SonarCloud for Better Code Quality.
                5. **Automating Dependency Management**: Using Dependabot
                6. **Dockerizing your services**: A Step Forward in Our DevOps Journey
                7. **Container Register**:

                After this "DevOps Days" series, I'll be sharing even more .NET-related content, including:

                - Repositories & UnitOfWork Patterns.
                - Result Pattern Framework.
                - EF Core SQL Server second-level caching with REDIS
                - Message Brokers and Storage
                - OData vs REST vs GraphQL
                - HealthChecks
                - Writing Tests for Layered Applications

                Things will get even more interesting along the way‚Äîstay tuned! üöÄ

                ---

                Prerequisites:

                I am developing this project using the following tools:

                * Visual Studio Community 2022
                * All the plugins listed in this [article](./must-have-visual-studio-extensions.html).
                * Git Bash
                * Docker Desktop

                ---

                ## Setting up Nzr.Acme

                The first step was to initialize the project on a git repository. For this project, I opted to use GitHub as the primary hosting platform, even though I was heavily using Azure Devops. I will write an article comparing both platforms in the near future.

                To keep this article concise, I'll omit some specific GitHub configurations for now, but those details will be covered in upcoming articles - stay tuned!

                ### Step 1: Creating the remote repository

                I began by creating an empty repository on GitHub named nzr.acme, which will serve as the remote repository for tracking and storing all project changes.

                ### Step 2: Initializing the Project Locally

                I created a new folder on my local machine and initialized a Git repository within it using the following commands:

                ```bash
                mkdir nzr.acme
                cd nzr.acme
                git init
                ```

                If you're using Windows, I recommend running the following command [1]:

                ```bash
                git config --global core.autocrlf true
                ```

                This initialized an empty Git repository on my local machine.

                ### Step 3: Setting the Main Branch

                TTo align with GitHub conventions [2], I renamed the default branch to `main`::

                ```bash
                git branch -M main
                ```

                ### Step 4: Adding the Remote Origin

                I linked my local repository to the remote repository created earlier on GitHub by adding the remote origin:

                ```bash
                git remote add origin https://github.com/marionzr/nzr.acme.git
                ```

                To verify the connection, I checked the remote:

                ```bash
                git remote -v
                ```

                Instead of steps 1‚Äì4, I could have simply cloned the repository using `git clone`, but I wanted to demonstrate the manual approach.

                ### Step 5: Adding Initialization Scripts

                Over the years, I've written various scripts and utilities to streamline project initialization. For Nzr.Acme, I added the following artifacts to the repository:

                - `commit-msg`: A hook script to validate commit messages against conventional commit standards. [3]
                - `pre-commit`: A hook script that prompts with questions to ensure the code is thoroughly checked before committing. [4]
                - `init.sh`: This script configures the local git repository, adding the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks to enforce consistent commit messages.
                - `rename.sh`: This script allows a quick rebranding of the project by replacing the term "Acme" in file names, directories, and contents.

                These scripts are written in shell to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

                ### Step 6: Running the Initialization Script

                ```bash
                #!/bin/bash

                # Define the state file path inside the .git directory
                STATE_FILE=".git/.init.state"

                # Check if the state file exists
                if [[ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
                    echo -n "The script has been executed before. Do you want to run it again? (y/n):"
                    while true; do
                        # Read a single character immediately without needing to press Enter
                        read -n 1 response
                        echo  # Move to the next line after input

                        # Convert response to lowercase and check if it is 'y'
                        case "${response,,}" in
                            [Yy] ) break;;  # Proceed if 'y' or 'Y'
                            [Nn] )
                                echo "Exiting the script."
                                exit 0;;  # Exit if 'n' or 'N'
                            * ) echo -n "Please answer with 'y' or 'n': " ;;
                        esac
                    done
                fi

                # Copy the commit-msg to the git/hooks directory, overwriting if it exists
                cp -f commit-msg .git/hooks/
                echo "commit-msg file copied to .git/hooks/"

                # Copy the pre-commit to the git/hooks directory, overwriting if it exists
                cp -f pre-commit .git/hooks/
                echo "pre-commit file copied to .git/hooks/"

                # Update the state file with the date, time, and reset message
                {
                    echo "Script executed on: $(date)"
                    echo "Remove this file to reset."
                } > "$STATE_FILE"

                ```

                I ran the init script `init.sh` to configure the commit-msg and pre-commit hooks and ensure the repository was ready for development:

                ```bash
                ./init.sh
                ```

                ### Step 7: Committing and Pushing to GitHub

                Finally, I added the `.gitignore`, `README.md` and `LICENSE` files and committed the changes with a descriptive commit message and pushed the code to the GitHub repository:

                ```bash
                git add .
                git commit
                git push -u origin main
                ```

                That's it! The project setup is complete and ready for development.

                ---

                ## Final Thoughts üí°

                This initial setup lays the groundwork for Nzr.Acme, a project that I hope will be a useful starting point for developers.
                The next article will describe how I initialized the .NET solution and the projects.
