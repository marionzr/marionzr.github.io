                Modern software development thrives on automation. To keep up with the fast pace of delivery while ensuring quality, a robust Continuous Integration (CI) process is essential.

                In this article, I'll walk you through how I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of building and testing the Nzr.Acme solution. This not only streamlines development but also enforces stricter code quality standards.

                This is the third article in the "DevOps Days" series for the Acme project. If you missed the previous one, check the **Related contents** at the end of this page.

                ## Understanding GitHub Actions

                Before I dive into the details, let's briefly explore what GitHub Actions are. GitHub Actions enable developers to automate workflows directly in their GitHub repositories. They provide a powerful way to define events (like pushes or pull requests) that trigger specific workflows, ensuring reliable CI/CD processes.

                ---

                ## Building the Workflow

                The GitHub Actions workflow I created for Nzr.Acme is designed to build and test the solution automatically whenever changes are made to the `main` branch or a pull request targets it. Let's take a closer look at the structure of this workflow:

                ### Head: Name and Triggers

                ```yaml
                name: Build & Test the Solution

                # This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of building and testing the solution.
                # It ensures that every push or pull request targeting the 'main' branch meets build and test quality standards.
                # The workflow reduces manual effort, increases reliability, and provides faster feedback to developers during the CI process.

                on: # Triggers
                push:
                    branches:
                    - main
                pull_request:
                    branches:
                    - main
                ```

                The head of the workflow defines its purpose and specifies the events that trigger it:

                - **Name**: The workflow is named `Build & Test the Solution` to clearly indicate its purpose.
                - **Triggers**: The workflow listens for two events: pushes to the `main` branch and pull requests targeting the `main` branch. This ensures that any changes to critical branches are verified before merging.

                ### Jobs: Build and Test

                ```yaml
                jobs:
                build-and-analyze:
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                ```

                The workflow contains a single job, `build-and-test`, which runs on an ubuntu-latest virtual machine. This job is divided into six steps, each with a specific purpose:

                #### Step 1: Checkout Code

                ```yaml
                steps:
                    # Step 1: Checkout the code with full history
                    - name: Checkout code
                    uses: actions/checkout@v3
                ```

                This step uses the `actions/checkout` action to clone the repository onto the runner.

                #### Step 2: Set Up .NET

                ```yaml
                # Step 2: Set up .NET
                    - name: Set up .NET
                    uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
                    with:
                        dotnet-version: '9.0'
                ```

                The `actions/setup-dotnet` action sets up the required .NET runtime and SDK on the runner. Here, I've specified .NET version 9.0 to align with the project requirements.

                #### Step 3: Cache NuGet Packages

                ```yaml
                # Step 3: Cache NuGet packages
                    - name: Cache NuGet packages
                    uses: actions/cache@v3
                    with:
                        path: ~/.nuget/packages
                        key: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-${{ hashFiles('**/*.csproj', '**/*.fsproj', '**/global.json') }}
                        restore-keys: |
                        ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-
                ```

                Caching NuGet packages speeds up future builds by preventing redundant downloads. This step uses a hash of relevant files (like `.csproj` and `global.json`) to determine whether to restore the cache or fetch fresh packages.

                #### Step 4: Restore Dependencies

                ```yaml
                # Step 4: Restore dependencies with fail-fast
                    - name: Restore dependencies
                    run: dotnet restore || exit 1
                ```

                #### Step 5: Build Solution

                ```yaml
                # Step 5: Build the solution
                    - name: Build solution
                    run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release
                ```

                The `dotnet build` command compiles the solution using the `Release` configuration. The `--no-restore` flag ensures that previously restored dependencies are not restored again, improving efficiency.

                #### Step 6: Run Tests

                ```yaml
                # Step 6: Run tests
                    - name: Run tests
                    run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release
                ```

                Finally, the `dotnet test` command executes all tests in the solution. The `--no-build` flag skips the build step since the solution has already been built.

                Below is the full file, but for the [most up-to-date version](https://github.com/marionzr/nzr.acme/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml), check it directly on the Nzr.Acme GitHub repository.

                ```yaml

                    run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release
                ```

                ## Automation in Action

                The same commit will trigger the workflow, along with any subsequent commits pushed to the main branch or any new pull request targeting it.
                A yellow icon appears next to the pull request title, indicating the workflow is in progress.
                Clicking on it directs you to the Actions page for details.

                <div class="img-small">

                ![Actions in Progress](../assets/articles/build-and-test-with-github-actions/6d4e18fa-0441-409a-a33b-98a1882ac3b9.png)

                Upon success, a ✅ green checkmark appears next to the commit title, signifying a completed workflow.

                </div>

                In case of an issue, a ❌ appears next to the commit message, indicating a failed build.

                ## Enforcing Workflow Rules for Consistency

                ![Branch Ruleset](../assets/articles/build-and-test-with-github-actions/ff7f7b83-50e6-4f76-9ce8-26ca5559c971.png)

                To ensure that all changes are validated by this workflow, I updated the repository settings to block direct pushes to the main branch. This enforces the use of pull requests, providing a controlled environment for code review and automated checks. Here are the key settings I configured:

                ### Ruleset: build-and-test-must-pass

                - **Enforcement Status**: Active
                - **Target Branches**: Default (main)

                ### Branch Rules

                - **Require a Pull Request Before Merging**: I've enabled this to ensure all changes go through a pull request. Since I'm coding solo, I left those two options, highlighted in red, unchecked, but I'd recommend enabling them for team projects.

                ![Pull Request Completion Rules](../assets/articles/build-and-test-with-github-actions/6ad90352-16a9-42a2-873e-2569d68e1b92.png)

                - **Require Status Checks to Pass**: I checked all options here and added the build-and-test workflow to ensure all changes pass tests and build before merging.

                ![Status Check Rules](../assets/articles/build-and-test-with-github-actions/becc0eb6-7e3d-4de3-8f44-6ba293e782be.png)

                ---

                ## Final Thoughts 💡

                By implementing this GitHub Actions workflow and enforcing branch protection rules, we can built a strong CI foundation for the .NET solutions.
                This automation minimizes manual intervention, reduces errors, and guarantees that every change adheres to high-quality standards.

                In the next article, I will tell you how I introduced another workflow to perform SonarCloud Code Analysis. Stay tuned.
