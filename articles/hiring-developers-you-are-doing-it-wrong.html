                I have been hired ten times in my career. Each time was different, but I learned something new. For a long time, I thought that being a good developer meant I could also hire good developers. I was so sure of myself! I thought, "I know what makes a developer good because I am one." I was wrong.

                Since my first IT job back in 2003, I helped hire many developers. Over all these years, I saw everything. I had funny interviews where people could not answer basic questions. I dealt with people who quit at the last minute after we spent weeks talking to them. And yes, I also found some amazing team members who made our work better. I didn't always handle the whole process from start to finish, but I often helped make the final choice about who to hire.

                But after doing this many times, I started to ask myself some hard questions: Should I spend my time doing this? Is this the best use of my skills as a developer? Could someone else do this job better than me? These questions led me to find a better way.

                ---

                ## How Most Companies Hire Developers

                Most places follow the same steps when looking for developers. While some details might be different, the big picture looks like this:

                ### 1. **Posting Jobs and Getting Applications**
                They write a job description that lists what skills they need, how much experience they want, and what the person will do. Then people send in their papers, sometimes with links to their code on websites like GitHub.

                ### 2. **Looking at All the Papers**
                Someone at the company, often a manager or someone from HR, reads all these papers. They try to find people who have done similar work before and have the right skills.

                ### 3. **First Talk on Phone or Video**
                The people with the best papers get invited to talk. This first talk is usually with someone from HR. They check if the person can talk well, if they might fit in the team, and if they know the basics of the job.

                ### 4. **Testing Their Coding Skills**
                The people who do well in the first talk get tested on their coding. They need to solve problems, write code, and answer technical questions. The testers watch how they solve problems and how well they code.

                ### 5. **Giving Them a Coding Task**
                Sometimes, people are asked to do a coding task at home or while someone watches. If the job is for a senior role, they might also be asked to design a whole system.

                ### 6. **One Last Big Meeting**
                The best people might meet many team members for more tests. This might even include having lunch with the team to see how everyone gets along.

                ### 7. **Making an Offer and Talking About Pay**
                After all the tests, the company picks the best person and makes an offer. They talk about pay, benefits, and work conditions. Some companies also check the person's background and call their old bosses.

                ---

                ## Why I Like Short Hiring Steps

                Hiring a developer takes time. Some companies have very long processes with many steps. Others try to make it shorter. I prefer to keep the hiring process short and simple. I often put the culture talk and coding test in one meeting instead of having many meetings. Why do I like it this way?

                - Most developers already have jobs and are busy with work and life. They shouldn't need to make up stories to take time off for many interviews.
                - If you take too long to decide, someone else will hire the good people first. I've lost great developers because we were too slow.
                - When we need to hire, we usually need help fast. Someone left, or we have too much work. If the hiring takes months, the work keeps piling up and everyone gets stressed.

                ## The Big Problem: Finding Good People

                What if you don't get enough people applying for your job? Or what if the people who apply don't have the skills you need? This is where things get really hard. This is the real bottleneck.

                If you or your team has to look through fifty or a hundred papers from people who aren't right for the job, you waste a lot of time. Time you could use to do your real work - coding, fixing bugs, building new features. It feels like throwing hours into a black hole.

                So I asked myself: Why not let someone else do this part? Why not let experts handle finding the right people?

                ---

                ## Why I Started Working With Recruiters

                I've had great times working with recruiters, both when I was hiring and when I was looking for a job myself. Good recruiters know the job market really well. They know where to look for people. They have the right tools and ways to find people with exactly the skills you need.

                Many recruiters even know enough about tech to pick out the right people before sending them to you. They can tell if someone is really a Java expert or just put it on their paper. So why do companies think they can do this job well while also doing all their normal work?

                I remember the first time I worked with a good recruiter. Instead of getting fifty papers with only two good ones, I got five papers and four were perfect for the job! I saved so much time that I could focus on my real work.

                ### The Hidden Cost of Doing It Yourself

                Some companies don't want to pay for recruiters. They think, "Why pay someone when we can do it ourselves?" But have you ever added up how much your last hiring process really cost?

                Think about how many hours your team spent reading papers, doing interviews, and setting up meetings. How many people were involved? How many hours did each person spend? Now think about how much you pay those people per hour. Add it all up. The "free" way of hiring isn't really free at all.

                Last time I hired someone without a recruiter, my team spent over 40 hours on the process. With our average pay, that cost the company more than what a recruiter would have charged! And we still didn't find the right person.

                ### How Recruiters Save You Money 💶💵

                Recruiters don't just save time; they find better people. Your team won't waste hours looking at papers from people who aren't a good fit. They can focus on talking to the best ones.

                This makes the hiring process faster and less frustrating. It also means you're more likely to get good people before other companies hire them. In the fast world of tech, being slow means losing the best people.

                With a recruiter, your developers can keep doing what they do best - developing software. They don't need to become part-time HR people. This keeps your projects moving forward even while you're hiring.

                ### The Power of Their Networks

                Another big plus of using recruiters is that they know a lot of people. They have big networks. They talk to developers all day, every day. They know who is looking for a job and who might be open to a change even if they're not actively looking.

                They can reach people who aren't even looking for jobs but might be perfect for your team. These "passive candidates" are often the best ones, but you would never find them just by posting a job online.

                A good recruiter can find top people that you would never find on your own. They can tell you, "I know someone who's not happy at their job right now and has exactly the skills you need."

                ### Making The Deal Smoother

                Recruiters are also good at talking about money. This part is often awkward when you do it yourself. Recruiters know what people in your area usually get paid for different jobs and levels of experience.

                They can help make sure everyone is happy with the deal. They act as a bridge between you and the candidate. They can say things like, "The company really wants you but can't go higher than X. Would you consider other benefits instead?"

                This stops those awkward talks about pay and helps close deals faster. It reduces the chance of losing someone just because the money talk didn't go well.

                ---

                ## Final Thoughts on Better Hiring

                I want to be clear about something: I still feel completely capable of hiring developers. My technical skills haven't diminished, and I can spot talent when I see it.
                In fact, I genuinely enjoy the hiring process. The excitement of meeting potential team members, discussing technical challenges, and imagining how they might fit into our projects brings me real satisfaction.
                If asked, I would happily participate in the hiring process ten more times with the same enthusiasm.

                But here's the reality I've come to accept: enjoying a process doesn't mean it's the most effective use of my time or skills.
                Professional recruiters bring specialized expertise that even the most skilled technical leads simply don't possess.
                They have extensive networks built over years, deep understanding of the current job market, and refined techniques for identifying both active and passive candidates.

                If your company has the budget to invest in hiring, don't hold back because of pride or tradition.
                Find skilled recruiters who understand your industry, spend time clearly explaining the technical requirements you need, and communicate your expectations for team culture and work ethic.
                Then let them do what they do best - finding exceptional talent.
