                In this article, I'm taking a big step forward—containerizing my application with Docker. This will streamline deployments, improve consistency, and simplify orchestration.

                I'll explore the new Dockerfiles, introduce a docker-compose.yml file for easier orchestration, and extend my build pipeline to validate Docker image builds.

                This is the sixth article in the "DevOps Days" series for the Acme project. If you missed the previous one, check the related content at the end of this page. I highly recommend going through them to understand the foundation I've built so far.

                ## Introducing Docker to Nzr.Acme

                To enable containerization, I created separate Dockerfiles for the GraphQL, REST, and AUTH Web API projects. Let's dive into the GraphQL API Dockerfile, as the other Dockerfiles are nearly identical.

                ## The GraphQL API Dockerfile

                The Dockerfile follows a multi-stage build pattern. I structured my Dockerfile in two stages:

                1. **Build Stage**: Compiles and publishes the application.
                2. **Final Stage**: Creates the runtime environment.

                ### Build Stage: Compiles and publishes the application

                The first stage uses the SDK image to build and publish the application:

                ```dockerfile
                # Stage 1: Build Stage
                # ===================
                # This stage compiles the application and creates the published artifact

                FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
                WORKDIR /src

                ARG PROJECT_NAME=Acme.Api.GraphQL

                # Copy the project file
                # FIXME: docker:S6470
                COPY . .

                RUN dotnet restore "${PROJECT_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}.csproj"
                RUN dotnet build "${PROJECT_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}.csproj" --no-restore -c Release
                RUN dotnet publish "${PROJECT_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}.csproj" --no-build -c Release -o /artifacts
                ```

                #### Understanding the Build Stage

                Let me break down each component of the build stage:

                1. Base Image Selection

                - I use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` as the base image
                - This image includes the full .NET SDK, necessary for building and publishing
                - The `AS build` label allows me to reference this stage later

                2. ##### Working Directory

                - `WORKDIR /src` creates and sets the working directory
                - This keeps my build context organized and provides a consistent path reference

                3. Project Configuration

                - `ARG PROJECT_NAME` allows me to parameterize the project name
                - This makes the Dockerfile more reusable across different projects

                4. Build Process

                - I separated the restore, build, and publish commands for better layer caching
                - The `--no-restore` and `--no-build` flags prevent redundant operations
                - Output is directed to `/artifacts` for easy access in the next stage

                I decided to copy the entire solution directory (using `COPY . .`) instead of individual project files. While this isn't always considered best practice, it offers a pragmatic advantage in complex solutions:

                - Ensures all necessary dependencies are available.
                - Simplifies multi-project builds.
                - Reduces potential issues caused by missing files.

                While this approach might result in temporarily larger image layers during build time, the final image remains optimized since it only contains the published artifacts. The simplicity and reliability of this approach often outweigh the minor inefficiencies in the build process, especially in projects where build reliability is more critical than build time optimization.

                ### Final Stage: Creates the runtime environment

                The second stage uses the lighter ASP.NET runtime image to run the application.

                All unnecessary build artifacts and intermediate files are left behind in the build stage

                ```dockerfile
                # Stage 2: Final Stage
                # ===================
                # This stage creates the actual image that will run in containers

                FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS final
                WORKDIR /app

                # Add a non-privileged user
                ARG APP_UID=1000
                USER $APP_UID

                ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://+:80;https://+:443"
                EXPOSE 80
                EXPOSE 443

                COPY --from=build /artifacts .

                # Specify the command to run when the container starts
                # Using the explicit DLL name because environment variables aren't expanded in ENTRYPOINT
                # The ENTRYPOINT instruction makes this container behave like an executable
                ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Acme.Api.GraphQL.dll"]
                ```

                #### Understanding the Final Stage

                My final stage is optimized for runtime performance:

                1. Runtime Image

                - I use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0`, which is significantly smaller than the SDK image
                - It contains only the runtime components needed to execute the application
                - This results in a more secure and efficient production image

                2. Network Configuration

                - The `EXPOSE` instructions document the ports my application uses
                - I configured the environment variable `ASPNETCORE_URLS` for Kestrel to listen on both HTTP and HTTPS
                - This dual-protocol support is crucial for development and production environments

                3. Application Setup

                - `COPY --from=build` only brings over the published artifacts
                - The `ENTRYPOINT` ensures my application starts correctly
                - I used array syntax `["dotnet", "Acme.Api.GraphQL.dll"]` for better signal handling

                4. Security Considerations

                - Run containers as non-root to implement least privilege principle

                The REST and Auth Dockerfiles follow the same pattern, with only the PROJECT_NAME and application name differing.  For now, I've kept the duplicate Dockerfiles for simplicity.

                ## Docker Compose and Environment Configuration

                My docker-compose.yml file serves multiple purposes:

                1. Simplifies local development
                2. Provides consistent environment setup
                3. Manages service dependencies
                4. Handles SSL certificate generation

                ```yaml
                # Dear developer, please create a .env file in the same directory as this docker-compose.yml
                # and define the following variables there:
                # ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTP_PORT, ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTPS_PORT,
                # ACME_REST_HTTP_PORT, ACME_REST_HTTPS_PORT and
                # CERT_PASSWORD
                #
                # Example .env file:
                # CERT_PASSWORD=mypass@123
                # APP_UID=1920
                # ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTP_PORT=4000
                # ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTPS_PORT=4001
                # ACME_REST_HTTP_PORT=5000
                # ACME_REST_HTTPS_PORT=5001
                # ACME_AUTH_HTTP_PORT=8080
                # ACME_AUTH_HTTPS_PORT=8081

                services:
                # Certificate Generator Service
                cert-generator:
                    image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0
                    container_name: cert-generator
                    volumes:
                    - acme-volume:/shared/certs
                    working_dir: /app
                    command: >
                    bash -c "
                        dotnet dev-certs https -ep /shared/certs/aspnetapp.pfx -p ${CERT_PASSWORD} &&
                        dotnet dev-certs https --trust &&
                        chmod 644 /shared/certs/aspnetapp.pfx &&
                        ls -l /shared/certs"

                # GraphQL API Service
                acme-api-graphql:
                    image: acme-api-graphql:latest
                    container_name: acme-api-graphql
                    build:
                    context: ./src
                    dockerfile: Acme.Api.GraphQL/Dockerfile
                    ports:
                    - "${ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTP_PORT}:80"
                    - "${ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTPS_PORT}:443"
                    networks:
                    - acme-network
                    volumes:
                    - acme-volume:/shared/certs
                    environment:
                    - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
                    - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/shared/certs/aspnetapp.pfx
                    - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=${CERT_PASSWORD}
                    depends_on:
                    cert-generator:
                        condition: service_completed_successfully

                # REST and Auth services follow similar configuration...

                networks:
                acme-network:
                    driver: bridge

                volumes:
                acme-volume:
                    driver: local
                ```

                ### Key Features of My Docker Compose Setup

                1. Service Dependencies: I use `depends_on` with condition checking to ensure proper startup order. This ensures, for example, the certificate generation process completes before starting the services.

                2. Volume Management: My volume configuration supports:

                - Certificate sharing between services
                - Persistence across container restarts

                3. Environment Configuration: allows us to configure some settings of the services without need to changing the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

                - Example of an extended .env file with additional configurations:

                ```env
                # API Ports
                ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTP_PORT=4000
                ACME_GRAPHQL_HTTPS_PORT=4001
                ACME_REST_HTTP_PORT=5000
                ACME_REST_HTTPS_PORT=5001
                ACME_AUTH_HTTP_PORT=8080
                ACME_AUTH_HTTPS_PORT=8081

                # Security
                CERT_PASSWORD=mypass@123
                ```

                ## Extending the CI Workflow to Validate Docker Builds

                I've extended the build & test CI workflow to include Docker build validation:

                ```yaml
                # Step 7: Set up Docker Buildx
                - name: Set up Docker Buildx
                uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

                # Step 8: Verify Docker builds
                - name: Verify Docker builds
                run: |
                    echo "$DOCKER_PROJECTS" | while read -r project; do
                    if [ -n "$project" ]; then
                        echo "Building Docker image for $project..."
                        tag=$(echo "$project" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
                        docker build \
                        --file "./src/$project/Dockerfile" \
                        --build-arg ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development \
                        --tag "$tag:test" \
                        ./src || exit 1

                        # Additional validation steps
                        echo "Running security scan on $tag:test..."
                        docker scan "$tag:test" || true

                        # Verify image size
                        echo "Checking image size..."
                        docker image inspect "$tag:test" --format='{{.Size}}' || exit 1
                    fi
                    done

                # Step 9: Validate docker-compose
                - name: Validate docker-compose configuration
                run: docker-compose config
                ```

                Here you can see some of the docker images running on Docker Deskop.

                If you'd like to understand the CI pipeline that I'm extending here, check out my previous article in the series where I detail the original build and test workflow.

                ## Final Thoughts 💡

                Containerizing is a game-changer. It improves portability, enhances development consistency, and streamlines deployments. With Docker Compose simplifying local setups and a CI pipeline ensuring reliability, this marks a major milestone for the project.

                The addition of docker-compose.yml simplifies local development, and the extended CI workflow ensures stability.

                The containerization of ACME apps brings several benefits:

                - Consistent development environments
                - Simplified deployment process
                - Better resource isolation
                - Improved scalability potential

                In the next and final article in this series, I'll demonstrate how to "upload" the Docker image to a container registry.
