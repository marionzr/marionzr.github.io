                Modern software development demands reliable and repeatable deployment processes. By automating Docker image builds and pushing them to container registries, I establish a foundation for consistent deployments across different environments.

                Automating the process of building images for multiple projects and pushing them to both DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry is one of the final steps in how I distribute containerized applications.

                This is the last article in a seven-part series covering the "DevOps Days" for the Acme project. Now, I'll demonstrate how to automate Docker image building and deployment using GitHub Actions. This automation ensures consistency, reduces manual effort, and streamlines the deployment pipeline.

                ## Understanding the Building Blocks

                Before diving into the workflow details, let's explore the key components that enable this automation.

                - A Dockerfile serves as a blueprint for creating Docker images, defining the environment, dependencies, configurations, and commands required to build and run an application. It provides a structured and repeatable way to package applications, ensuring consistency across different environments. In my microservices architecture, each service maintains its own dedicated Dockerfile, allowing independent versioning, customization, and deployment. This modular approach ensures that changes to one service do not affect others, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in the overall system.

                - Docker images are immutable packages created from Dockerfiles that contain everything necessary to run an application. They encapsulate the application code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring that the application operates consistently across different environments. This isolation prevents discrepancies between development, testing, and production systems, reducing the risk of environment-related issues. By packaging an application and all its dependencies into a single portable unit, Docker images enable seamless deployment, scalability, and version control, making them a fundamental building block of modern containerized applications.

                - Container registries are centralized repositories that store, manage, and distribute Docker images, enabling seamless deployment across different environments. They serve as a crucial component in DevOps workflows, allowing teams to version, secure, and share containerized applications efficiently. The top five most widely used container registries are:
                  - Docker Hub - The default and most popular registry for Docker images, offering public and private repositories.
                  - GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) - Integrated with GitHub, providing fine-grained access control and seamless authentication for GitHub users.
                  - Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) - A managed registry by AWS, optimized for deploying containers within the AWS ecosystem.
                  - Google Artifact Registry (GAR) - Google's next-generation container registry, supporting multi-cloud and hybrid deployments.
                  - Azure Container Registry (ACR) - A Microsoft Azure service designed for seamless integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure cloud services.

                These registries play a key role in modern cloud-native development, ensuring secure storage, version control, and efficient container distribution.

                I'm utilizing two popular registries: DockerHub, the default public registry for Docker images, and GitHub Container Registry, which integrates seamlessly with GitHub.

                ## Setting Up DockerHub Integration

                To enable pushing images to DockerHub, I needed to configure several components. First, create a DockerHub account by visiting [hub.docker.com](hub.docker.com) and following the registration process. After creating an account, you'll need to create a repository to store your images. For my microservices architecture, I've chosen to use a single repository for all services, which simplifies management and provides a centralized location for images.

                Security is paramount when automating deployments. To allow GitHub Actions to push images to DockerHub, I needed to configure authentication credentials. Generate a DockerHub access token by navigating to your DockerHub account settings and selecting [Personal access tokens](https://app.docker.com/settings/personal-access-tokens). Then, click on **Generate new token**. You need to give permission to **Read & Write**

                ![Docker Hub PAT](../assets/articles/automating-docker-image-deployments/063e30e4-aa84-465e-be20-34927deb7cd0.png)

                Store this token securely in your GitHub repository's secrets with the name `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`. Additionally, store your DockerHub username as `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`.

                ![Docker Hub PAT](../assets/articles/automating-docker-image-deployments/26b5f1b8-8aa8-40a0-9c33-5634127894a2.png)

                ## Leveraging GitHub Container Registry

                GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) provides several advantages for teams already using GitHub. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub's authentication system and provides fine-grained access control through repository permissions. Unlike DockerHub, GHCR doesn't require a separate account setup - it uses your GitHub credentials and personal access tokens.

                To enable GHCR integration, create a personal access token with the appropriate permissions (read/write access to packages) and store it in your GitHub repository's secrets as `GH_PAT_BUILD_AND_PUSH_DOCKER_IMAGES`. This token allows the workflow to authenticate and push images to GHCR.

                ## Automating Image Builds with GitHub Actions

                The GitHub Actions workflow, triggered on pushes to the main branch, orchestrates the entire process of building and publishing Docker images.

                The workflow uses environment variables to define crucial settings:
                The workflow processes each project iteratively, building and pushing images for each one.
                This approach provides flexibility - adding a new service requires only adding its name to this list.

                Here is the complete file:

                ```yaml
                # This workflow automates the process of building and pushing Docker images for multiple projects.
                # It runs on every push to the main branch, builds Docker images for the specified projects,
                # and pushes the images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry.

                name: Build and Push Docker Images

                on:
                push:

                            docker push "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-${SHORT_SHA}"

                            # Tag and push with run ID
                            docker tag ${IMAGE_NAME}:temp "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-${{ github.run_id }}"
                            docker push "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-${{ github.run_id }}"

                            # Tag and push with 'latest' tag

                            fi
                        done
                ```

                Let's examine the key components of this automation:

                ### Environment Variables

                ```yaml
                env:
                DOCKERHUB_REGISTRY: docker.io
                GITHUB_REGISTRY: ghcr.io
                DOCKER_PROJECTS: |
                    Acme.Api.REST
                    Acme.Api.GraphQL
                    Acme.Auth
                APP_UID: ${{ vars.APP_UID }}
                DOCKERHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_REPOSITORY }}
                ```

                - DOCKER_PROJECTS: Lists the projects whose Docker images need to be built and pushed.
                - DOCKERHUB_REGISTRY & GITHUB_REGISTRY: Define where images will be pushed.
                - APP_UID: Used for containerized application security.
                - DOCKERHUB_REPOSITORY: Specifies the repository name for storing images.

                ###  Authentication to Registries

                The workflow logs into both DockerHub and GHCR using stored secrets:

                - name: Login to Docker Hub
                uses: docker/login-action@v3
                with:
                    registry: ${{ env.DOCKERHUB_REGISTRY }}
                    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
                    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

                - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
                uses: docker/login-action@v3
                with:
                    registry: ${{ env.GITHUB_REGISTRY }}
                    username: ${{ github.actor }}
                    password: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_BUILD_AND_PUSH_DOCKER_IMAGES }}

                ### Building and Pushing Images

                The workflow showcases different tagging strategies to maintain traceability and version control:

                ```yaml
                # Tag and push with commit SHA
                docker tag ${IMAGE_NAME}:temp "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-${SHORT_SHA}"
                # Tag and push with run ID
                docker tag ${IMAGE_NAME}:temp "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-${{ github.run_id }}"
                # Tag and push with 'latest' tag
                docker tag ${IMAGE_NAME}:temp "${REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}-latest"
                ```

                Each built image is tagged in three ways:

                - Commit SHA (${SHORT_SHA}) ensures precise version tracking.
                - GitHub Actions run ID (${{ github.run_id }}) identifies the exact build.
                - `latest` tag simplifies deployments using the most recent image.

                The images are built using docker build, and each project is iterated over in the script, ensuring all necessary services get containerized and pushed automatically.

                This multi-tagging approach provides flexibility in deployment scenarios while maintaining traceability to specific code versions.

                ## Final Thoughts 💡

                Automating Docker image builds and deployments with GitHub Actions represents a significant step toward modern DevOps practices. This automation reduces manual intervention, ensures consistency, and provides a foundation for scaling deployment processes.
